# Collection of some assignments of [AtCoder.jp](https://atcoder.jp/)

Mostly implemented in C++14 with [meson](http://mesonbuild.com/)

## Generate and run a program template

    # Create assignment 190_1
    ./generate 190_1
    
    # Edit/Solve the assignment
    cd 190_1;
    open main.cpp
    
    # Run it
    ../run .


##  Why cpp?  
I have tried other language I am more familiar with like Java/Javascript, they consume too much memory and executiong time sometimes exceeds limits of assignments. Swift was also one of my candidates but as of 2019/09/14, AtCoder's swift version is old and syntax is a bit different.

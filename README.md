# Collection of some assignments of [AtCoder.jp](https://atcoder.jp/)

mostly implemented in cpp

##  Why cpp?  
Because same algoriths in other language languages sometimes do not pass tests (Java, Javascript consume too much memory and/or time)
I considered swift too but now (2019/09/14) swift version in atcoder.jp is old and syntax is a bit different.

## Run a program
